## Freshsubs
Freshsubs is a fast food franchise that sells sandwiches and salads. It is the third largest single-brand restaurant chain. The process of making a freshsub is displayed 
below with each step carried out in the sequence shown.

| Activity | Processing time (in seconds) |
|----------|:------------------------------:|
| Placing the order | 34.57 |
| Meats + Cheese + Heating | 21.58 |
| Veggies + Sauces | 27.65 |
| Billing | 30 |

1. What is the capacity of each process (in sandwiches per hour)?

2. What is the process capacity (in sandwiches per hour)?

3. Which process is the bottleneck?

4. What is the utilisation for each process?

5. What is the process cycle time for the overall system (in seconds)?

6. If one of their stores operate 10 hours a day 22 days a month, what is the monthly capacity of the process (in sandwiches per month)? Assume that there is sufficient demand.

## Very-freshsubs
Very-freshsubs is a startup and aiming to compete in the same space as Freshsubs. While thinking of their process design, Abu Hassan, Very-freshsubs operations
guru, proposed to perform a waiting time analysis on Freshsubs as a benchmark. The details of his study is shown in the table below. Assume that there is only
one cashier that does the billing, i.e., m = 1.

| | Mean (in minutes) | Standard deviation (in minutes) |
|-----|:-----:|:-----:|
| Inter-arrival time | 2.44 | 1.98 |
| Process time | 0.99 | 0.02 |

1. Compute CVa.

2. Compute CVp.

3. What percentage of the time is the cashier busy?

4. What is the average time spent waiting in line to get to the cashier (in seconds)?

5. What is the average time that a customer spends in the system (in seconds)?

## GloRoofs
GloRoofs specialises in roofing products such as roof tiles and trusses. They have 11 retail outlets across Indonesia with a factory located just outside
Jakarta. To remain competitive, GloRoofs focussed on obtaining access to high quality raw materials and an inexpensive labour supply while leveraging on their
prior expertise. Their operations are also labour intensive and GloRoofs realise that some level of streamlining needs to be carried out to sustain their cost
advantage. The following information was extracted from their accounting ledger:

| | 2015 |
|-----|-----:|
| Inventory | $1,217 |
| COGS | $442,105 |

1. What is the inventory turnover ratio?

2. If the profit margin is 50%, what is the total annual sales?

3. How many days, on average, did a product stay in inventory in 2015?

## Arts and Craft Co. Ltd (A&C)
A&C manufacturers soft toys for the mass market. With their multi-skilled labour force, A&C is able to perform different kinds of activities.
They have a basic production line and feel that their processes could be improved as it has been affecting the overall utilisation during peak demands. The A&C
production line consists of 3 steps. Assume that the working hours are 8 hours per day. For each hour of work, each worker is allowed a 5 minute break.

| Activity | Number of resources | Processing time (min/unit) |
|-----|-----|:-----:|
| Cutting | 6 cutting machines | 0.36 |
| Sewing | 100 workers | 50 |
| Handcraft & Packing | 50 workers | 10 |

1. What is the capacity of each activity?

2. What is the process capacity?

3. What is total productive time for sewing in minutes?

4. What is the idle time per worker for sewing in minutes?

5. What is total productive time for handcraft and packing in minutes?

6. What is the total idle time for handcraft and packing in minutes?

7. How long will it take for the process to complete 2000 units? The flow rate is computed to be 1.63 units per minute. Assume that parts are discrete and the
system starts empty.
