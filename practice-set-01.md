## Freshsubs
Freshsubs is a fast food franchise that sells sandwiches and salads. It is the third largest single-brand restaurant chain. The process of making a freshsub is displayed 
below with each step carried out in the sequence shown.

| Activity | Processing time (in seconds) |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Placing the order | 34.57 |
| Meats + Cheese + Heating | 21.58 |
| Veggies + Sauces | 27.65 |
| Billing | 30 |

1. What is the capacity of each process (in sandwiches per hour)?

2. What is the process capacity (in sandwiches per hour)?

3. Which process is the bottleneck?

4. What is the utilisation for each process?

5. What is the process cycle time for the overall system (in seconds)?

6. If one of their stores operate 10 hours a day 22 days a month, what is the monthly capacity of the process (in sandwiches per month)? Assume that there is sufficient demand.

## Very-freshsubs
Very-freshsubs is a startup and aiming to compete in the same space as Freshsubs. While thinking of their process design, Abu Hassan, Very-freshsubs operations
guru, proposed to perform a waiting time analysis on Freshsubs as a benchmark. The details of his study is shown in the table below. Assume that there is only
one cashier that does the billing, i.e., m = 1.

| | Mean (in minutes) | Standard deviation (in minutes) |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Inter-arrival time | 2.44 | 1.98 |
| Process time | 0.99 | 0.02 |

1. Compute CVa.

2. Compute CVp.

3. What percentage of the time is the cashier busy?

4. What is the average time spent waiting in line to get to the cashier (in seconds)?

5. What is the average time that a customer spends in the system (in seconds)?
