# Practice questions for Operations Management
These questions were adapted from outcomes of class projects carried out by my students. All credit goes to them and it is my sincere hope that they will also
drive the change that the system needs.

Please refer to [Acknowledgements](acknowledgements.md) for a list of contributors, i.e., my former students.

If you are an instructor and require an answer key, please send an e-mail to niakwu.koh at gmail.com from your institutional email address with the following
information:

- Your name
- Your institution
- The number of students taking your course

After I verify that you are a legitimate instructor, I will send you information about how to access the answer keys.

To err is human. If any errors are found or if you have any suggestions about possible improvements, please create an issue right here in Github. 

## Converting to pdf
If you would like a downloadable pdf of the practice questions, simply replace github.com with gitprint.com at the markdown of your choice.
