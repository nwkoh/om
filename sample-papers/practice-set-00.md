## R-Rider
The R-Rider is a fitness bike that acts as a green power station - it generates power while in use. There are five R-Rider fitness bikes in Hungkuang Technology
University and the students generate about 150 kWh of energy per month through the pedalling. Generated energy is fed into the power generation system which in turn
provides electricity for the school. The technology enabling this is a regenerative inverter drive.

The activities required to assemble an inverter is shown below. Each activity requires one worker.

| | Activity | Processing time (min/unit) |
|-----|-----|:-----:|
| 1 | Assembly 1 | 4 |
| 2 | Assembly 2 | 3 |
| 3 | Assembly 3 | 7 |
| 4 | Assembly 4 | 6 |
| 5 | Calibration 1 | 3 |
| 6 | Calibration 2 | 4 |
| 7 | Packaging | 1.5 |

1. What is the utilisation for each process?

2. Which activity is the bottleneck?

3. How many units can be produced daily? Assume that there are 7 working hours in a day.

4. What is the utilisation of each process if daily demand is for 50 inverters?

5. What is the flow rate?

6. What is the idle time for each worker in minutes per unit?

## Gerry and Sonya
Gerry and Sonya each forecast the monthly sales of their main product for a year
in advance. At the end of the year, they compared their results as shown below.
By comparing the mean squared error, who produced the better forecast?

| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|-----|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Demand | 40 | 44 | 52 | 38 | 28 | 30 | 27 | 38 | 54 | 45 | 51 | 56 |
| Gerry | 34 | 46 | 48 | 44 | 34 | 32 | 30 | 32 | 36 | 38 | 41 | 43 |
| Sonya | 30 | 40 | 44 | 48 | 38 | 36 | 42 | 40 | 42 | 44 | 44 | 44 |

Solution: The forecast produced by Gerry has a mean squared error that is smaller. This
confirms that his forecasts are, on average, better.
