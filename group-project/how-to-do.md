# How to do the group project

A large portion of your time will be spent producing the As-Is value stream map
(VSM). If you are reading this, you also know that we will need to populate the data
boxes for those VSMs.

You can think about it as building up the line for the selected product.

Some suggestions:

1. First understand how to make that product. While doing this, take note of the
   machines used.

2. Find specifications for the machines. A good starting point is Alibaba.com.

3. There will be several machines with different specifications. To keep it
   simple, select a wide range of machine capacities. By doing this, you
would have something to improve on later.


### Things to note

1. Resolving the bottleneck is the easiest initiative. If it is easy, everyone will
be doing it too.

2. This project is fairly difficult. No pain, no gain.
