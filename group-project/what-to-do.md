# What to do for the group project

Objective: To propose one initiative that will streamline a manufacturing process

Please use the Operations Management (OM) knowledge that you have gained to strengthen the discussion.

### Guidelines

1. Carry out a SWOT of the company

    - This will help you understand the company's competitive position

2. Select a single product

    - One product = one value stream

3. Map out the process for that product and analyse it

    - Produce the As-Is value stream map and identify opportunities for improvement

4. Propose one initiative to improve that process and quantify it

    - To improve throughput, reduce cost or any other useful metric

5. Map out the To-Be process

    - Produce the To-Be value stream map after implementing the two initiatives

### Assumptions

Model the process as a supply constrained system so bottlenecks can be identified

### Duration

15 minutes (presentation) + 5 minutes (Q&A)

### Number of slides

20 slides for the content (excluding cover page and appendices)
